# ðŸ“Š SOS-ETSEIB

An open-source file repository for university students to share, rate, and comment on files, aiding exam preparation. Developed with Java without a framework, PostgreSQL, and Cloudflare R2 for file storage. The front end is server-side generated using Java, JTE, and HTMX.

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies

- `Java`
- `Maven`
- `HTMX`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `Cloudflare R2 / AWS S3`
- `JavaScript`

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Authentication**: Custom session based auth system with HttpOnly cookies, including email verification and account recovery.
- **File Uploads**: Users can upload files directly to a public Cloudflare R2 Bucket.
- **Social Interaction**: Students can rate, comment, and discuss files, enhancing collaboration.

## ðŸ“š Learnings

### Spring Boot Insights

- Gained understanding of Spring Boot internals by replicating key features.

### Session Based Auth System

- Implemented an auth system based on sessions stored in a DB to emulate a scalable system based on microservices to authenticate users using multiple distribution servers.

### Java Templating Engine

- Explored backend HTML templating for crafting efficient static sites.

### HTMX

- Experimented with this UI Library for dynamic, interactive front ends.
